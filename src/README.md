Side Notes:

if you have more time or just want to practice a new React skill, here are some ideas for improving your tic-tac-toe game that can increase the difficulty.


1. Please display the positions of each move in a specific format (row, column) in the list of move records.

2. Please highlight the currently selected item in the list of moves.

3. Please rewrite the Board to use two loops instead of hardcoding when creating the rectangles.

4. Please add a toggle button to sort the moves in ascending or descending order.

5. When a winner is determined, please highlight the three rectangles that caused the victory.

6. If there is no winner, please display a message indicating a draw.
